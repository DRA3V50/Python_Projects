- **SOC_Log_Triage.py**  
  A Python tool to analyze SSH and firewall logs, detect suspicious IP activity, and categorize IPs into Blocked, Escalate, or Double-check groups based on configurable thresholds.  
  Requires you to create a `SOC.log` file in the same folder as the script.  
  (Optional) For colored output, install Colorama via pip.

- **SOC_Threat_Filter.py**
  A real-time SOC threat simulation dashboard built using Pythonâ€™s Turtle graphics. It visualizes simulated security logs, displays live severity counts, and shows color-coded alerts for different threat levels. Perfect for SOC visualization, cybersecurity demonstrations, or training simulations. Requires no additional files or external packages.
