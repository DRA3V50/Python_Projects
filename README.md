# Python Projects

A collection of Python scripts and mini-projects focused on cybersecurity tasks, automation, and security testing.

## Warning

**These Python scripts are meant for learning and practice only. They simulate cybersecurity tasks, automation, monitoring, and data analysis in a safe and controlled way.**

**They should not be used on real systems, live networks, or data unless you have clear permission to do so. Any scripts related to monitoring, password handling, or security testing are intended to help build understanding, not to cause harm.**

*Please use these projects responsibly and ethically as part of your learning and skill development.*

## Project Overview

- **BOT_Optional_Choosing.py**  
  Requires no additional files or installations.

- **Mini_Game_Guess_Number.py**  
  Requires the `COOKIE.png` image and some PIP package installations.

- **Would_You_Rather_Game.py**  
  Requires PIP package installations only.

- **Hangman_Game.py**  
  Requires PIP package installations only.

- **Bank_Account.py**  
  Requires PIP package installations only.

- **Monitering.Network.Pentest.Firewall_Config.py**  
  Requires PIP package installations only.

- **Castle_Hero.py**  
  Requires PIP package installations only.

- **Password_Crack.py**  
  Requires no additional files or installations.

- **SOC_Log_Triage.py**  
  A Python tool to analyze SSH and firewall logs, detect suspicious IP activity, and categorize IPs into Blocked, Escalate, or Double-check groups based on configurable thresholds.  
  Requires you to create a `SOC.log` file in the same folder as the script.  
(Optional) For colored output, install Colorama via pip.

- **SOC_Threat_Filter.py**
  A real-time SOC threat simulation dashboard built using Python’s Turtle graphics. It visualizes simulated security logs, displays live severity counts, and shows color-coded alerts for different threat levels. Perfect for SOC visualization, cybersecurity demonstrations, or training simulations. Requires no additional files or external packages.

- **Data_Analytics_&_Automation.py**
  This Python script acts like a mini SOC analyst. It creates event data, finds unusual activity, and uses color to show severity levels LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and CRITICAL. The script prints a simple report so you can quickly see patterns and anomalies.

- **Access_Audit_Management_System.py**
   This script uses a Resident Evil theme to simulate access log management, including viewing, editing, and deleting records. It emphasizes data auditing, record tracking, and analytical practices, demonstrating skills relevant to entry-level data analyst and blue team roles.

## Setup and Usage

Some projects require certain Python packages to be installed via pip. To install the required packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

### For **SOC_Log_Triage.py**

- Create a log file named `SOC.log` in the same directory as the script.  
- Populate it with SSH and firewall logs (sample entries provided in the project).

### For **SOC_Threat_Filter.py**
- Just copy and paste it to test it out + run it.
- You can edit it the script in your project directory + run it.
